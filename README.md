## 3️⃣ Setup PostgreSQL

You can use Docker:

```bash
docker run --name prismadb \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=devex \
  -d -p 5432:5432 postgres
```

---

## 4️⃣ Create Dummy `.env` Files

### 📦 `packages/db/.env`

```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:devex@localhost:5432/postgres"
```

---

### 🌐 `apps/api/.env`

```env
PORT=4000
```

---

### 🖥 `apps/web/.env.local`

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:4000
```

---

## 5️⃣ Run Prisma Migration

```bash
cd packages/db
npx prisma migrate dev
npx prisma generate
```

---

## 6️⃣ Seed System Accounts & Reserve

Buy price > Sell price  
Platform earns from bid/ask difference.

## Reserve Guard
Trading is blocked if system silver reserve is insufficient.

---

# 🧮 Accounting Model

All movements follow double-entry bookkeeping.

### BUY Flow

1. USER_INR → SYSTEM_INR (net amount)
2. USER_INR → SYSTEM_REVENUE_INR (fee)
3. SYSTEM_SILVER → USER_SILVER

---

### SELL Flow

1. USER_SILVER → SYSTEM_SILVER
2. SYSTEM_INR → USER_INR (net)
3. SYSTEM_INR → SYSTEM_REVENUE_INR (fee)

---

# 🧠 Risk Layers

1. Trade amount validation
2. User balance validation
3. Reserve guard
4. Atomic DB transactions
5. Global error middleware
6. Async route wrapper

---

# 🧪 Manual Testing Checklist

2. Deposit INR
3. Buy Silver
4. Sell Silver
5. Open Prisma Studio:
